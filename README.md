Statistics-and-Data-Analysis-in-Python

This Kernel is an index accompanying a series of tutorial notebooks introducing Python for data analysis. This series is intended for those new to data science, programming and Python. It is an updated version of a guide I previously posted on my blog.

I am also creating a 30-Part YouTube series covering each lesson in a video format. If you're interested in that, view the [Python for Data Analysis Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiC1doDIe9rCYWmH9wIEYEXXaJ4KAi3jc).
