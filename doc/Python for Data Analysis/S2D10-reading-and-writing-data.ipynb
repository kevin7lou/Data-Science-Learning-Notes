The pandas package comes equipped with several data reading and writing functions that let you read data directly from common file formats like comma separated values files (CSV) and Microsoft Excel files. This lesson will focus on reading and writing data from these common file formats, but Python has packages available to work with just about every data format you encounter."

    "The Internet gives you access to more data than you could ever hope to analyze. Data analysis often begins with getting data from the web and loading it into Python. Websites that offer data for download usually let you download it as CSV, TSV or excel files. Perhaps the easiest way load web data, is to simply download data to your hard drive and then use the functions we discussed earlier to load it into a DataFrame.\n",

    "If you are running Python locally, reading from the clipboard is another quick and dirty option for reading web data and other tabular data. To read data from the clipboard, highlight the data you want to copy and use the appropriate copy function on your keyboard (typically control+C) as if you were going to copy and paste the data. Next, use the pd.read_clipboard() function with the appropriate separator to load the data into a pandas DataFrame. Since we are using Kaggle's kernel environment for this guide we will not be reading from the clipboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas also comes with a read_html() function to read data directly from web pages. To use read_html() you need the HTML5lib package. Install it by opening a command console and running \"pip install HTLM5lib\" (without quotes). Note that HTML can have all sorts of nested structures and formatting quirks, which makes parsing it to extract data troublesome. The read_html() function does its best to draw out tabular data in web pages, but the results aren't always perfect. Again, since we are using the Kaggle kernel environment for this guide, we won't be using read_html() as it does not seem to play well with Kaggle's notebook environment. When it comes to using outside data on Kaggle, your best bet is to download the data to your local machine and then upload it to Kaggle as a dataset that you can add to your project.\n",
